            <h2>Genesis</h2>
            
            <p>Back in 2017, I borrowed my dad's ID to register on an exchange called http://Coins.ph and invested $200 into Bitcoin when it was trading at around $4,000.</p>

            <p>Not really understanding what Bitcoin was or its purpose. After few days of watching my investment dip, I converted it back to fiat.</p>
            
            <p>I was just a teenager, 15 years of age, full of curiosity, I don't know anything about crypto.</p>
            
            <p>They say to try everything in your twenties, and I took that advice to heart.</p>
            
            <p>I've tried:
                <br>
                > Video filming and editing
                <br>
                > Programming
                <br>
                > Copywriting
                <br>
                > E-commerce
                <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>Nothing really clicked, and school felt like a waste of time since I had no career path in mind.</p>
            
            <p>Fast forward to 2023, crypto trading pulled me back in. I wasn't serious about learning, I was just copytrading. Got liquidated and then quit.</p>
            
            <p>This year, I got lured back by a promising project that turned out to be a scam but fortunately, I managed to get my $300 back just before they pulled the rug on everyone.</p>
            
            <p>Then, in March, I saw a post from an e-commerce guy made $10k from some burger shitcoin.</p>
            
            <p>Intrigued, I jumped in, downloaded Phantom, and started trading.</p>
            
            <p>I was blindly swapping funny meme coins without any risk management, just following the crowd on X, joined TG groups, doing some raids, got betrayed, deceived.</p>
            
            <p>I was addicted, lost $1k, wanting revenge for all my losses, took a $400 loan, and again lost it all.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the debts, I didn't quit. I was getting smarter, noticing market manipulation, using tools, understanding the don'ts.</p>
            
            <p>With my last $300 from my stock investment account, I gambled again, and again lost it all.</p>
            
            <p>I worked my ass off freelancing, got back into gambling on shitcoins, and hit a $20k jackpot in June.</p>
            
            <p>Paid off debts, helped family, and gave back to the less fortunate I encountered, giving huge tips. I felt rich for a while.</p>
            
            <p>Then, I moved out of my comfort zone to learn and grow as a person.</p>
            
            <p>Lost $10k more gambling shitcoins and spent $8k on random things and on myself, leaving me with $2k. Will I survive? That's the goal.</p>
            
            <p>Now it's the month of September, I've finally put into action my realization that low-cap shitcoins are just that, pure shit.</p>
            
            <p>I'm done chasing those quick wins, thinking long-term, it's not sustainable, it's a rabbit hole if you're not smart with your money.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the negativity about shitcoins, I'm truly grateful because it introduced me to a world I'm may now passionate about.</p>
            
            <p>They're a gateway for many, and I'm one of the lucky ones who survived.</p>
            
            <p>Each day, diving deeper into crypto, I find it much more interesting.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding of the potential it offers - the decentralization, geographical and time freedom - it's just pure opportunity in today's world.</p>
            
            <p>It's time to commit fully. I need to learn, research, and strategize.</p>
            
            <p>This is the beginning of my journal, writing is a formal way of thinking and in this way, it's helping me process what I've learned.</p>
            
            <p>Years from now, I hope to look back and see that every word I've written in this online journal was all worth it.</p>
            
            <p>Now, it's time to learn and survive.</p>
